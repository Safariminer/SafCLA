# SafCLA
Creators using music under SafCLA must agree to:
- Credit the original artist
- Ask permission before using the music commercially
- Not use the music in a political context(rallye, vote, speech, etc...)
- Not sell the music alone(eg: must be bundled with a game, can't be published on Spotify if not the original artist)

If an artist contacts you to ask you to remove content using music under SafCLA, you must comply.
